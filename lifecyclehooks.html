    Lifecycle hooks
    4 phases
    1.creation, 2.mounting, 3.updating, 4.unmounting 
lifecycle hooks are methods that allow us to hook into or tap into these different phases in the lifeccycle 
of a component and execute some code
Creation: This is the stage when a component is being created but not yet inserted into the DOM. 
It involves initializing the component's data and props.

Mounting: During this stage, the component is being added 
to the DOM for the first time. This is where you might want
 to perform actions that need access to the DOM.

Updating: When the component's data changes, 
the updating stage occurs. This is where you can react 
to changes in data or props and make adjustments accordingly.

Unmounting: When a component is removed from the DOM,
 the unmounting stage happens. This is where you can 
 perform cleanup tasks, such as canceling timers or removing event listeners, 
 to prevent memory leaks.
